## Introduction

**crond.io** is a crond daemon that lives on the internet. It is a cron-as-a-service that schedules HTTP calls and collects responses for analysis. It can be used to trigger workflows on the internet like mail campaigns or monitor the health of your services. It is fully programmable over a REST API and comes with a pretty UI as well.

### Getting Started

Head on to [https://www.crond.io](https://www.crond.io) and sign in with your GitHub account. Once you have authenticated, you can start scheduling tasks right away from the web based user interface manually or you can grab your API key from the account settings and get started with the REST API to programatically schedule tasks.



> The service is in its beta stage and imposes a limit of 100 tasks per account. The product is not production ready yet and will not be responsible for any loss of data. It aims to be a free service for everyone.
