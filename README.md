## Introduction

**crond.io** is a crond daemon that lives on the internet. It lets you schedule HTTP calls on the internet with a cron, and collects response statistics. It can be used to trigger workflows like mail campaigns or even perform status checks for your services, and is fully programmable over a HTTP REST API.
