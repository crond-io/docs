## Introduction

**crond.io** is a crond daemon that lives on the internet. It is a _cron-as-a-service_ that schedules HTTP calls and collects responses for analysis. It can be used to trigger workflows on the internet like mail campaigns or monitor the health of your services. It is fully programmable over a REST API and comes with a pretty UI as well.

### Getting Started

Head on to [https://www.crond.io](https://www.crond.io) and sign in with your GitHub account. Once you have authenticated, you can start scheduling tasks right away from the web based user interface manually or you can grab your API key from the account settings and get started with the REST API to programatically schedule tasks.

### Motivation

A publicly available reliable scheduler offers separation of scheduling concerns for distributed applications on the internet. Serverless architectures can take advantage of this service as a cloud-provider-agnostic scheduler. The project is actively seeking help to keep it running freely for everyone.
